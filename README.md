# Personal setup for macroquad with egui integration

As the title suggests, this is my personal project that i can clone in order to get quickly set up with
[macroquad](https://github.com/not-fl3/macroquad#macroquad "macroquad") with an
[egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui#-egui-an-easy-to-use-gui-in-pure-rust "egui")
integration. Maybe if the time comes i will learn how to use
[bevy](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy#readme "bevy")
but it seems very confusing to me at the moment.
